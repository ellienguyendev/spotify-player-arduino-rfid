This contains 3 sketches that you will upload to your Arduino board and the wiring diagram to reference when configuring our hardware. The first two are used to initialize our projects and Sketch 3 will be the main program that lives on our board.

- Sketch 1: Get unique IDs of each NFC card
- Sketch 2: Create and authenticate your Spotify app
- Sketch 3: Read NFC cards to play albums and control the Spotify player
